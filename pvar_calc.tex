\begin{abstract}

The article deals with calculation of $p$-variation of 
the fine sample. Firstly, the mathematical properties that
appears to be useful for calculation of the value of 
$p$-variation are presented and proofed. 
Secondly,
the procedure that calculates $p$-variation is introduced.
In addition, this algorithm could be used to investigate
the $p$-variation of any piecewise monotone functions.
This procedure is denoted \emph{pvar} and it is publicly
available in R environment package \emph{pvar}.

\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}

The $p$-variation is a generalization of the total variation of a function,
namely, it is supremum of the sums of the $p$-th
powers of absolute increments off over nonoverlapping intervals 
(the formal definition is given in Definition~\ref{def:pvar}).
The total variation is a special case of $p$-variation, then 
$p=1$, i.e. the total variation is equal to $1$-variation.

The $p$-variation was first defined by Wiener in 1924 \cite{Wiener1924}.
In this work, the main focus was on $2$-variation. 
Later on, Young extended
the topic of $p$-variation in his work \cite{Young1936}, there 
he analysed $p$-variations with $p \neq 2$. 
Lots and detailed information on the known properties 
of $p$-variation can be found in the books of  Norvaiša and
Dudley (see \cite{DudleyNorvaisa1998} and \cite{DudleyNorvaisa1999}). 
There are formulated and proved a lot of the properties of $p$-variation.
In addition, the comprehensive bibliography of $p$-variation is include.

A regulated function $f$ is called \emph{rough}
if its $1$-variation value is infinite.
The class of rough functions appears to be quite an important one.
Probably the best know example of rough function is 
a trajectory of Wiener process. 
The Wiener is a well known process (see \cite{Karatsas1997}) 
used in statistics, physics and economic (\cite{Econ1997}).
It is worth noting, that rough functions 
can not be investigated 
with regular tools of calculus like
derivative or Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral.
The $p$-variation plays an important role in the filed of
rough function analysis. 
Firstly, the $p$-variation gives a convenient way to measure 
a degree of roughness. 
Secondly, it appears that $p$-variation is a very useful tool 
in calculus of rough functions.
A good overview of the importance of $p$-variation in rough function
analysis is given in \cite{Norvaisa2005}.
 
  
The exact value of $p$-variation was not used to be a topic.
Rather, the primary focus on $p$-variation properties 
is whether the $p$-variation bounded or unbounded. 
But the the work \cite{NorvaisaRackauskas2008} presented by
Norvaiša and Račkauskas greatly increased the motivation
of obtaining the the exact value of $p$-variation.
The work \cite{NorvaisaRackauskas2008} presents
necessary and sufficient conditions
for the convergence in law of partial sum processes in
$p$-variation norm. 
The result could be applied in the statistical data analysis,
which uses $p$-variation as data statistics.
For applying those theoretical result in data analysis it is necessary
to have procedure that actually calculates the value of $p$-variation.
Nonetheless, it seams that there is no proposed 
procedure of calculation of $p$-variation value.

The main goal of this article is to present the algorithm,
which calculates $p$-variation of the sample
(see Def.~\ref{def:pvarseq}), and give all the mathematical proofs
of the properties that were used in this algorithm.
The algorithm is denoted as \emph{pvar}.
It is already realised in the R environment (see~\cite{R})
and it is publicly available in \emph{pvar} package on CRAN\footnotemark.
It is worth noting, that this procedure could be used to calculate
$p$-variation of any piecewise monotone function.

}

The mathematical properties that where used in the
algorithm are presented and proved in the next section of this article.
In addition, all known properties that are relevant to this work
are listed with the reference to original works. Namely, in large extent
we use the properties presented in J.~Qian Ph.D. thesis \cite{Qian}\footnotemark.
In the Section~\ref{sec:pvarcalc} we will present the \emph{pvar}
algorithm that calculates the $p$-variation of the sample.

The main purpose of this sections is to 
ground all the properties of $p$-variations 
that were used in the calculation of $p$-variation.
The Theorem~\ref{th:notinST} is considered to
be the most important mathematical result,
which is quite general and possible could be used
in many situations. It gives the criteria of 
identifying the points that can not be in supreme partition.
In addition, Proposition~\ref{prop:pvar_sum_x}
appears to be quite useful as well. It provides 
necessary and sufficient condition for summing the 
$p$-variation.
All the other properties are used as as helping statements
in the proofs or they are specificity formulated 
to be used in the \emph{pvar} algorithm, nevertheless, 
someone could find them to be useful as well.

%%% Definition of partition %%% 
% Status
\begin{definition}[Partition]\label{def:pp}
  Let $J = [a,b]$ be a closed interval of real numbers with 
  $-\infty < a \leq b <+\infty$. 
  If $a < b$, an ordered set $\kappa = \{x_{i}\}_{i=0}^{n}$ 
  of points in $[a,b]$ such that a  
  $a=x_{0}<x_{1}<x_{2}<...<x_{n}=b$ is called a \emph{(point) partition}. 
  The size of the partition is denoted $\left|\kappa \right| :=\#\kappa-1=n$. 
  The set of all point partitions of $[a,b]$ is denoted by $PP[a,b]$.  
\end{definition} 
 
%%% Definition of $p$-variation %%% 
% Status:OK
\begin{definition}[$p$-variation]\label{def:pvar}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a real function from 
  an interval $[a,b]$.
  If $a<b$, for  $\kappa =\{x_{i}\}_{i=0}^{n} \in PP[a,b]$ 
  the \emph{$p$-variation sum} is 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:def_pvarsum}
    s_{p}(f,\kappa):=\sum_{i=1}^{n}| f( x_{i}) -f( x_{i-1})|^{p},
  \end{equation}
  where $0<p<\infty $. Thus, the \emph{$p$-variation} 
  of $f$ over $[a,b]$ is $0$ if $a = b$ and otherwise
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:def_pvar}
    v_{p}(f) =v_{p}(f,[a,b]) :=\sup \left\{
    s_{p}(f,\kappa ):\kappa \in PP[a,b]\right\}.    
  \end{equation}
  
  The partition $\kappa$ is called \emph{supreme partition} 
  if it satisfies the property $v_{p}(f) = s_{p}(f,\kappa)$.
  The set of such partitions is denoted
  $SP_{p}(f,[a,b])$.
  
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Elementary properties]\label{lm:element_properties} 
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $0<p<\infty $. 
  Then the following $p$-variation properties holds
  \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item \label{lm:ep_a} $ v_p(f,[a,b]) \geq 0 $,
    \item \label{lm:ep_b} $ v_p(f,[a,b]) = 0 \Leftrightarrow f \equiv Const. $,
    \item \label{lm:ep_c} $ \forall C \in \mathbb{R}: v_p(f+C,[a,b]) = v_p(f,[a,b]) $,  
    \item \label{lm:ep_d} $ \forall C \in \mathbb{R}: v_p(Cf,[a,b]) = C^p v_p(f,[a,b]) $,

    \item \label{lm:ep_f} $ \forall [a',b'] \subset [a,b] : v_p(f,[a,b]) \geq v_p(f,[a',b']) $.  
    \item \label{lm:ep_g} $ \forall \kappa \in PP[a,b]:s_{p}(f;\kappa) \leq v_p(f,[a,b]) $.

\subsection{General properties with proofs}


%%% VIP: p-variation is additive in meaningful points %%%
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:pvar_sum_x} 
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM and
  $\{x_i\}_{i=0}^n \in PP[a,b]$ is any partition of interval $[a,b]$. 
  Then the statement 
  \begin{equation}
    \exists \kappa \in SP_{p}(f,[a,b]):\forall i,x_i \in \kappa
  \end{equation}
  is equivalent to 
  \begin{equation}
    v_p(f,[a,b]) = \sum_{i=1}^n v_p(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]).
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Necessary. Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM,
  $\{x_i\}_{i=0}^n \in PP[a,b]$ and 
  \begin{equation}
    \exists \kappa \in SP_{p}(f,[a,b]):\forall i,x_i \in \kappa. 
  \end{equation}
  
  Points from the partition $\kappa$ will be denoted $t_i$, 
  i.e. $\kappa=\{t_i\}_{i=0}^m$.
  Then, according to definitions of $SP_{p}$ and 
  $p$-variation (def.~\ref{def:pvar}) the following equation holds
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ir1.eq1}
  v_p(f,[a,b])=s_{p}(f;\kappa)=\sum_{j=1}^{m}|f(t_{j-1})-f(t_j)|^p 
    = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=h(i-1)+1}^{h(i)}|f(t_{j-1})-f(t_j)|^p,
  \end{equation}  
  where $h:\{0,1,\dots,n\} \rightarrow \{0,1,\dots,m\}$ 
  denotes a function 
  from the set of index of $x$ to the set of index of $t$, namely:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ir1.eqx1}
    h(i):=(j_i : x_i = t_{j_i}=t_{h(i)}).
  \end{equation}  
  The equation (\ref{eq:ir1.eq1}) holds, because all the elements 
  in the sum remains, we just grouped them.
  
  Moreover, the inequality  
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ir1.eq2}
  \sum_{j=h(i-1)+1}^{h(i)}|f(t_{j-1})-f(t_j)|^p 
    \leq v_p(f,[x_{i-1},x_i])
  \end{equation}  
  holds according to Lemma \ref{lm:element_properties}(\ref{lm:ep_g}).
  
  As a result of (\ref{eq:ir1.eq1}) and (\ref{eq:ir1.eq2}) we get
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ir1.eq3}
    v_p(f,[a,b]) \leq \sum_{i=1}^n v_p(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]).
  \end{equation}
  
  On the other hand, according to the 
  Lemma~\ref{lm:element_properties}(\ref{lm:ep_e}) 
  the following inequality holds
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ir1.eq4}
    v_p(f,[a,b]) \geq \sum_{i=1}^n v_p(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]).
  \end{equation}
  
  Finally, from the (\ref{eq:ir1.eq3}) and (\ref{eq:ir1.eq4}) follows 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ir1.eq5}
    v_p(f,[a,b]) = \sum_{i=1}^n v_p(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]).
  \end{equation}
  
  Sufficiency. Suppose $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ir1.eq6}
    v_p(f,[a,b]) = \sum_{i=1}^n v_p(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]).
  \end{equation}
  
  According to Corollary~\ref{cor:SPNotEmpty}, 
  sets $SP_{p}(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]),\;i=1,\dots,n$ are not empty.  
  Lets take any partition from each of the 
  sets $SP_{p}(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]),\;i=1,\dots,n$ and denote it $\kappa_i$.
    
  
  Then, let define a joint partition $\kappa:=\cup_{i=1}^n \kappa_i$. 
  Points from the partition $\kappa$ will be denoted by $t_i$. 
  In addition, we will use the function $h$, 
  which is defined in (\ref{eq:ir1.eqx1}).
  Then, continuing the equation (\ref{eq:ir1.eq6}) we get
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ir1.eq7}
  v_p(f,[a,b]) = 
    \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=h(i-1)+1}^{h(i)}|f(t_{j-1})-f(t_j)|^p
    =\sum_{i=1}^{|\kappa|}|f(t_{i-1})-f(t_i)|^p.
  \end{equation}
  This means that $\kappa \in SP_{p}(f,[a,b])$. 
  Moreover, $\forall i:x_i \in \kappa$,
  because $\kappa=\cup_{i=1}^n \kappa_i$.  
\end{proof}


% The subset on the points of supreme partition is aditive
\begin{lemma}\label{lm:pvarSubset}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM 
  and $\{x_i\}_{i=0}^{n} \subset \kappa \in SP_{p}(f,[a,b])$. Then
  \begin{equation}
    \forall k,l: v_p(f,[x_k,x_l]) = 
      \sum_{i=k+1}^l v_p(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]),\; 0 \leq k<l\leq n. 
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\{x_i\}_{i=0}^{n} \subset \kappa \in SP_{p}(f,[a,b])$. 
  Let choose $k$ and $l$ such that $0\leq k<l\leq n$.
  Lets apply Proposition~\ref{prop:pvar_sum_x} for the partition
  $\{x_0,x_k,x_{k+1},\dots,x_{l-1},x_l,x_n\}$. Thus,
  \begin{equation}
    v_p(f,[a,b]) = v_p(f,[x_{0},x_k]) 
      + \sum_{i=k+1}^l v_p(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]) + v_p(f,[x_l,x_n]). 
  \end{equation}
  In addition, we can apply the same proposition for 
  the partition $\{x_0,x_k,x_l,x_n\}$, then
  \begin{equation}
    v_p(f,[a,b]) =  v_p(f,[x_{0},x_k]) + v_p(f,[x_k,x_l]) 
      + v_p(f,[x_l,x_n]). 
  \end{equation}
  By subtracting one equation form the other we get the result that
  \begin{equation}
    v_p(f,[x_k,x_l])= \sum_{i=k+1}^l v_p(f,[x_{i-1},x_i]). 
  \end{equation}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm:spSubset}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM 
  and $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^{n} \in SP_{p}(f,[a,b])$. Then
  \begin{equation}
    \forall k,l: v_p(f,[t_k, t_l]) = 
      s_p\left(f,\{t_i\}_{i=k}^{l}\right) ,\; 0 \leq k<l\leq n. 
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM 
  and $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^{n} \in SP_{p}(f,[a,b])$. 
  Let choose $k$ and $l$ such that $0\leq k<l\leq n$.
  Then 
  \begin{eqnarray}
    v_p(f, [a, b]) & = & s_p(f,\{t_i\}_{i=0}^{n}) \\
    & = & s_p(f,\{t_i\}_{i=0}^{k})+s_p(f,\{t_i\}_{i=k}^{l})
      +s_p(f,\{t_i\}_{i=l}^{n})\\
    \label{eq:spSubset_p1}  
    & \leq & v_p(f, [a,t_k]) + s_p(f,\{t_i\}_{i=k}^{l})
      +v_p(f, [t_l, b]).         
  \end{eqnarray}    
  The last inequality holds according to 
  Lemma~\ref{lm:element_properties}(\ref{lm:ep_g}).  
    
  On the other hand, from Proposition~\ref{lm:pvarSubset}
  we get
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:spSubset_p2}  
    v_p(f, [a, b]) = 
      v_p(f, [a,t_k]) + v_p(f,[t_k, t_l])
      +v_p(f, [t_l, b]).     
  \end{equation}      
  
  Form (\ref{eq:spSubset_p1}) and (\ref{eq:spSubset_p2})
  follows 
  \begin{equation} 
    v_p(f,[t_k, t_l]) \leq s_p(f,\{t_i\}_{i=k}^{l}).  
  \end{equation} 
  
  Finally, from Lemma~\ref{lm:element_properties}(\ref{lm:ep_g})
  we conclude that 
  \begin{equation} 
    v_p(f,[t_k, t_l]) = s_p(f,\{t_i\}_{i=k}^{l}).  
  \end{equation}

% The point of supreme partition 
\begin{definition}[The supreme point]\label{def:psp}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM.  
  The point $x$ will be called the \emph{supreme point}
  if 
  \begin{equation}
    \exists \kappa \in SP_p(f, [a,b]): x \in \kappa.
  \end{equation} 
  The set of such points will be denoted by 
  $\overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])$.
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}\label{lm:psp} 
  Suppose $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is PM, 
  $x \in [a,b]$,
  $x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])$ and
  $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^n \in SP(f, [a, b])$ is any supreme partition.
  Then, 
  \begin{equation}
    \exists j=1,\dots,n: x \in (t_{j-1}, t_j) \text{ and } 
    x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_j]).
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose the assumptions of lemma is valid.
  Since $x \in [a,b]$ and $[a, b] = \cup_{i=1}^{n}[t_{i-1}, t_{i}]$,
  then 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:psp_p1}
    \exists j=1,\dots,n:x \in [t_{j-1}, t_{j}].
  \end{equation}    
  Moreover, $x \notin \{t_i\}_{i=0}^n$, 
  because $x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])$, thus,
  $x \neq t_{j-1}$ and  $x \neq t_{j}$. 
  In addition to (\ref{eq:psp_p1}) this means that 
  $x \in (t_{j-1}, t_{j})$.
    
  Now, we will proof that 
  $x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_j])$.
  Suppose to the contrary that 
  $x \in \overline{SP}_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_j])$. 
  Then, according to definition of 
  $\overline{SP}_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_j])$, 
  \begin{equation}
    \exists \kappa \in SP_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_j]): x \in \kappa.
  \end{equation}    
  Since, $\kappa \in SP_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_j])$, 
  then 
  \begin{equation}
    v_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_j])=s_p(f, \kappa)
  \end{equation} 
  
  Applying Proposition~\ref{prop:pvar_sum_x} 
  for partition $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^n$ we get
  \begin{eqnarray}
    v_p(f, [a, b]) &=& v_p(f, [t_{0}, t_{j-1}]) 
     + v_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_j]) + v_p(f, [t_{j}, t_n])\\
     &=& s_p(f, \{t_i\}_{i=0}^{j-1}) 
     + s_p(f, \kappa) + s_p(f, \{t_i\}_{i=j}^{n}) 
  \end{eqnarray}
   
  This means that the partition 
  $r:=\{t_i\}_{i=0}^{j-1} \cup \kappa \cup \{t_i\}_{i=j}^{n}$
  is supreme partition, so 
  $x \in r \in SP(f, [a, b])$, therefore, by definition
  $x \in \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])$. 
  This contradict to initial assumption. 
\end{proof}

  We will say that points $t_a$ and $t_b$ ($t_a<t_b$)

\begin{lemma}\label{lm:fjoin} 
  Suppose $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is PM and 
  points $t_a$ and $t_b$ ($t_a<t_b$) are 
  $f$-jointed in interval $[a,b]$.
  Then all following statements holds   
  \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item \label{lm:fjoin_a} 
    $v_p(f, [t_a,t_b]) = \left|f(t_a)-f(t_b)\right|^p$;
    
    \item \label{lm:fjoin_b} 
    Let $x \in [t_a, t_b]$. 
    If $f(t_a) \geq f(t_b)$, then $f(t_a) \geq f(x) \geq f(t_b)$.
    If $f(t_a) \leq f(t_b)$, then $f(t_a) \leq f(x) \leq f(t_b)$;
    
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \paragraph*{a)}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$  be PM, 
  $t_a<t_b$ and pair of points $t_a$, $t_b$ are $f$-joined. 
  Then exists $\{x_j\}_{j=0}^{n}$ and $j$ from the
  Definition~\ref{def:fjoin}.
  Thus, according to Lemma~\ref{lm:spSubset}
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:lm:fjoin_a}
    v_p(f,[t_{j-1}, t_j]) = 
      s_p\left(f,\{t_{j-1}, t_j\}\right) = \left|f(t_a)-f(t_b)\right|^p.
  \end{equation}      
  
  \paragraph*{b)}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM 
  and points $t_a$ and $t_b$ are $f$-joined.
  Since $f \stackrel{PM}{=} -f$, with out loss of 
  generality we can assume that
  $f(t_a) \leq f(t_b)$.  
  We will show that 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:fjoin_p1}
  \forall x \in [t_a,t_b]: f(x) \leq f(t_b).
  \end{equation}  
  Suppose to the contrary that 
  $\exists c \in [t_a, t_b]: f(c)>f(t_b)$. Therefore,
  $|f(c)-f(t_a)|^p>|f(t_b)-f(t_a)|^p$.
  According to (\ref{eq:lm:fjoin_a}), 
  $v_p(f,[t_a,t_b])=|f(t_b)-f(t_a)|^p$, 
  thus, $|f(c)-f(t_a)|^p>v_p(f,[t_a,t_b])$,
  but this contradicts the definition of $p$-variation.  
  So, (\ref{eq:fjoin_p1}) is valid.
  Symmetric arguments could be used for point $t_a$.  
  \begin{equation}
  \forall x \in [t_a,t_b]: f(x) \geq f(t_a).
  \end{equation}

%%% The monotonisy of Sp function %%%
\begin{lemma}\label{prop:Sp_Monoton}
  Suppose $C \in \mathbb{R}$, 
  $c_1\geq0$ and $1\leq p<\infty$. 
  Then function
  $f:[0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with the values
  \begin{equation}
  f(x) = ( x + c_1  )^p - x^p - C,\;x \in [0,\infty),  
  \end{equation}
  are non decreasing in interval $[0,\infty)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $C \in \mathbb{R}$, $c_1\geq0$ and $1\leq p<\infty$. 
  Then, for all $x \geq 0$, the derivative of the function $f$ is
  \begin{eqnarray*} 
    f'(x)   &=& p(x+c_1)^{p-1} - px^{p-1} \\
          &\geq& px^{p-1} - px^{p-1} = 0.
  \end{eqnarray*}  
  The derivative of function $f$ is non negative, 
  thus the function $f$ is non decreasing, if $x \geq 0$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{cor:convex}
  Suppose $c_1\geq0$, $C \in \mathbb{R}$, $1\leq p<\infty$ 
  and $0 \leq x \leq y$. 
  Then the following implication holds 
  \begin{equation}
  |x + c_1 |^p > x^p + C \Rightarrow |y + c_1 |^{p} > y^{p} + C.  
  \end{equation}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose  $0 \leq x \leq y$. 
  Since $f$ is non decreasing, $f(x) \leq f(y)$.
  Therefore, if $f(x)>0$, then $f(y)>0$.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:notinST} 
  Suppose $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is PM and
  $x \in [a', b'] \subset [a,b]$.    
  If $x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [a', b'])$, then 
  $x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM,
  $x \in [a', b'] \subset [a,b]$, 
  and $ x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [a', b'])$.
  Suppose to the contrary that
  $x \in \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])$.
  
  Since $x \in \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])$,
  according to the Definition~\ref{def:psp},
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:notinST_p1} 
    \exists \{t_i\}_{i=0}^n \in SP_p(f, [a, b]): x \in \{t_i\}_{i=0}^n.
  \end{equation}     
  
  Let $\{y_i\}_{i=0}^n \in SP_p(f, [a', b'])$ be any 
  supreme partition from the interval $[a', b']$. 
  Then, according to Lemma~\ref{lm:psp}, 
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:notinST_p2} 
    \exists j=1,\dots,n: x \in (y_{j-1}, y_j) \text{ and } 
    x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [y_{j-1}, y_j]).
  \end{equation}     
  Moreover, 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:notinST_p3} 
    x \notin \{a, y_{j-1}, y_j, b\},
  \end{equation} 
  because $x \in (y_{j-1}, y_j) \subset [a, b]$.  
  Thus, from (\ref{eq:notinST_p1}) and (\ref{eq:notinST_p3}) 
  follows that  
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:notinST_p4}
    \exists r \in \{1,2,\dots,n-1\} : t_r = x.
  \end{equation}  

  Lets denote variables $l$ and $k$ by
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    l &:=& \max \left\{i \in \{1,2,\dots,n-1\} : 
      t_i  \in (y_{j-1}, y_j) \right\}, \\
    k &:= &\min \left\{i \in \{1,2,\dots,n-1\} : 
      t_i  \in (y_{j-1}, y_j) \right\}.
  \end{eqnarray*}  
  Since $x \in (y_{j-1}, y_j)$ and (\ref{eq:notinST_p4})~holds, 
  the values $l$ and $k$ always exists and $k \leq r \leq l$. 
  According to $l$ and $k$ definitions the following inequality holds  
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:notinST_p5}
    t_{k-1} \leq y_{j-1} < t_{k} \leq x \leq t_{l} < y_j \leq t_{l+1}.
  \end{equation}
  
 
  According to Lemma~\ref{lm:element_properties}(\ref{lm:ep_e})
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:notinST_p6}
    v_p(f,[y_{j-1},y_j]) \geq v_p(f,[y_{j-1},t_{k}]) 
      + v_p(f,[t_{k},t_{l}]) + v_p(f,[t_{l},y_j]),
  \end{equation}      
  Firstly, let suppose   
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:notinST_p7}
    v_p(f,[y_{j-1},y_j]) = v_p(f,[y_{j-1},t_{k}]) 
      + v_p(f,[t_{k},t_{l}]) + v_p(f,[t_{l},y_j]).
  \end{equation}   
  Lets take any supreme partitions from intervals
  $[y_{j-1},t_{k}]$ and  $[t_{l},y_j]$, namely
  $\kappa_k \in SP_p(f,[y_{j-1},t_{k}])$ and
  $\kappa_l \in SP_p(f,[t_{l},y_j])$.  
  In addition, since $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^n \in SP_p(f, [a, b])$,
  according to Lemma~\ref{lm:spSubset},
  $v_p(f,[t_{k},t_{l}]) = s_p(f,\{t_i\}_{i=k}^l)$.
  Therefore,
  \begin{equation*}\label{eq:notinST_p8}
    v_p(f,[y_{j-1},y_j]) = s_p(f,\kappa_k) 
      + s_p(f,\{t_i\}_{i=k}^l) + s_p(f,\kappa_l).
  \end{equation*}  
  This means, that 
  \begin{equation*}\label{eq:notinST_p9}
    \kappa_k \cup \{t_i\}_{i=k}^l \cup \kappa_l 
      \in SP_p(f, [y_{j-1}, y_j]).
  \end{equation*} 
  So, 
  $x \in \overline{SP}_p(f, [y_{j-1}, y_j])$, 
  because $x \in \{t_i\}_{i=k}^l$.
  This contradicts (\ref{eq:notinST_p2}),
  thus, equality (\ref{eq:notinST_p7}) is not valid.
  As a result, inequality (\ref{eq:notinST_p6}) becomes
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:notinST_p10}
    v_p(f,[y_{j-1},y_j]) > v_p(f,[y_{j-1},t_{k}]) 
      + v_p(f,[t_{k},t_{l}]) + v_p(f,[t_{l},y_j]).
  \end{equation}    
  
  Since points $y_{j-1}$ and $y_j$ are $f$-joined,
  from the Lemma~\ref{lm:fjoin}(\ref{lm:fjoin_a}) we get
  \begin{equation*}\label{eq:notinST_p11}
    v_p(f,[y_{j-1},y_j]) = |f(y_{j-1})-f(y_j)|^p,
  \end{equation*}   
  therefore,
  \begin{equation*}\label{eq:notinST_p12}
    |f(y_{j-1})-f(y_j)|^p > v_p(f,[y_{j-1},t_{k}]) 
      + v_p(f,[t_{k},t_{l}]) + v_p(f,[t_{l},y_j]). 
  \end{equation*}        
  Moreover, according to 
  Lemma~\ref{lm:element_properties}(\ref{lm:ep_g}), 
  from the last statement follows
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:notinST_p13}
    |f(y_{j-1})-f(y_j)|^p > |f(y_{j-1})-f(t_{k})|^p +
       v_p(f,[t_k,t_l]) +  |f(t_{l})-f(y_j)|^p.   
  \end{equation}  
  
  Since $v_p(f)=v_p(-f)$ (see Proposition~\ref{prop:f_PM_g}), 
  with out loss of generality we can assume that
  $f(y_{j-1}) \geq f(y_j)$. 
  Hence, from the Lemma~\ref{lm:fjoin}(\ref{lm:fjoin_b}) 
  we get that
  \begin{eqnarray}
    f(y_{j-1}) \geq f(t_{l}) \geq f(y_j), \label{eq:notinST_14}  \\
    f(y_{j-1}) \geq f(t_{k}) \geq f(y_j). \label{eq:notinST_15}
  \end{eqnarray}  

  In addition, the pairs of points $\{t_l,t_{l+1}\}$ 
  and $\{t_{k-1},t_{k}\}$ are also $f$-joined, therefore,
  by the Lemma~\ref{lm:fjoin}(\ref{lm:fjoin_b})
  inequalities (\ref{eq:notinST_14}) and (\ref{eq:notinST_15})
  could be extended as
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:notinST_16} 
    f(y_{j-1}) \geq f(t_{l}) \geq f(y_j) \geq f(t_{l+1}),  \\
    \label{eq:notinST_17}
    f(t_{k-1}) \geq f(y_{j-1}) \geq f(t_{k}) \geq f(y_j). 
  \end{eqnarray}         
    
  
  From the (\ref{eq:notinST_16}) the following inequalities holds
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    f(y_{j-1})-f(t_l) &\geq& 0, \\
    f(t_{l})-f(t_{l+1}) \geq f(t_l)-f(y_j) & \geq & 0.
  \end{eqnarray*} 
  Therefore, we can use Corollary~\ref{cor:convex}. According to it,
  from the inequality (\ref{eq:notinST_p13}) follows  
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    |f(y_{j-1})-f(t_l)+f(t_l)-f(y_j)|^p &>& |f(y_{j-1})-f(t_{k})|^p +
       v_p(f,[t_k,t_l]) +  |f(t_{l})-f(y_j)|^p, \\  
    |f(y_{j-1})-f(t_l)+f(t_l)-f(t_{l+1})|^p &>&|f(y_{j-1})-f(t_{k})|^p
      + v_p(f,[t_k,t_l]) +  |f(t_{l})-f(t_{l+1})|^p, \\
    |f(y_{j-1})-f(t_{l+1})|^p &>& |f(y_{j-1})-f(t_{k})|^p 
      + v_p(f,[t_k,t_l]) +  v_p(f,[t_l,t_{l+1}]). 
  \end{eqnarray*}    
  The last inequality holds,
  because points $t_{l}$ and $t_{l+1}$ are $f$-joined,
  thus, according to Lemma~\ref{lm:fjoin}(\ref{lm:fjoin_a}),
  \begin{equation*}\label{eq:notinST_18}
    v_p(f,[t_l,t_{l+1}]) = |f(t_{l})-f(t_{l+1})|^p.
  \end{equation*}   


  
  Symmetric argument could be used in other direction. 
  Firstly lets modify last inequality
  \begin{equation*}\label{eq:notinST_19}
    |f(y_{j-1})-f(t_k)+f(t_k)-f(t_{l+1})|^p > |f((y_{j-1})-f(t_{k})|^p 
      + v_p(f,[t_k,t_l]) +  v_p(f,[t_l,t_{l+1}]). 
  \end{equation*}   
  From the (\ref{eq:notinST_17}) we get that
   the following inequalities holds
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    f(t_k)-f(t_{l+1}) & \geq & 0, \\
    f(t_{k-1})-f(t_{k}) \geq f(y_{j-1})-f(t_k) & \geq & 0.
  \end{eqnarray*} 

  Thus, from Corollary~\ref{cor:convex} we get
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    |f(t_{k-1})-f(t_k)+f(t_k)-f(t_{l+1})|^p&>&
      |f(t_{k-1})-f(t_{k})|^p+v_p(f,[t_k,t_l])+v_p(f,[t_l,t_{l+1}]), \\
    |f(t_{k-1})-f(t_{l+1})|^p &>& v_p(f,[t_{k-1},t_{k}]) 
      + v_p(f,[t_k,t_l])+v_p(f,[t_l,t_{l+1}]).
  \end{eqnarray*}  
  As previous, the last inequality holds, 
  because $t_{k-1}$ and $t_{k}$ are
  $f$-joined.

  Finally, using Lemma~\ref{lm:pvarSubset} we conclude that
  $$|f(t_{k-1})-f(t_{l+1})|^p > v_p(f,[t_{k-1},t_{l+1}]).$$
  This contradicts with the definition of $p$-variation.    
  
  
\end{proof}



\subsection{Extra results}

In this part we will present some helping statements that are 
formulates grand some operations in \emph{pvar} procedure.

\begin{definition}[Extremum]\label{def:extremum}
  We will call the point $t \in  [a,b]$ an \emph{extrema}
  of the function $f$ in interval $[a,b]$ if   
  $f(t)=\sup \left\{ f(z):z\in \left[ a,b\right]
  \right\} $ or 
  $f(t)=\inf \left\{ f(z):z\in \left[ a,b\right] \right\} $.
\end{definition}

%%% Global extremums are meaningful breaks %%% 
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:SplitMinMax}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is $PM$. 
  If point $x \in [a,b]$ is extrema of the function $f$, 
  then $x \in \overline{SP}_p(f,[a, b])$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is $PM$ and
  point $x \in [a,b]$ is an extrema of the function $f$.
  Let $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^{n} \in SP_p(f,[a,b]$ 
  be any supreme partition. 
  Then
  \begin{equation}
    \exists j \in 1,\dots,n: x \in [t_{j-1},t_j] 
  \end{equation}  

  Since $x$ is an extrema of function $f$ in interval
  $[a, b] \supset [t_{j-1},t_j]$, 
  the point $x$ is an extrema in interval 
  $[t_{j-1}, t_j]$ as well. Therefore,
  \begin{equation}
    f(t_{j-1})-f(t_{j})|^p \leq |f(t_{j-1}) - f(x)|^p
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}
    |f(t_{j-1})-f(t_{j})|^p \leq |f(x)-f(t_{j})|^p.
  \end{equation}
  As a result,
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  |f(t_{j-1})-f(t_{j})|^p 
    &\leq &|f(t_{j-1}) - f(x)|^p + |f(x) - f(t_{j})|^p,\\
  |f(t_{j-1}) - f(t_{j})|^p 
    &\leq & v_p(f, [t_{j-1}, x]) + v_p(f, [x, t_{j}]),\\
  v_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_{j}])
    &\leq & v_p(f,[t_{j-1}, x]) + v_p(f,[x, t_{j}]).
  \end{eqnarray*}    
  The last inequality holds, because $t_{j-1}$ and  $t_{j}$
  are $f$-joined, so, 
  $v_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_{j}])=|f(t_{j-1}) - f(t_{j})|^p$.
  Since $v_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_{j}])
    < v_p(f,[t_{j-1}, x]) + v_p(f,[x, t_{j}])$
  is not valid, the equation
  \begin{equation}
    v_p(f, [t_{j-1}, t_{j}])
    = v_p(f,[t_{j-1}, x]) + v_p(f,[x, t_{j}])  
  \end{equation}
  holds.
  
  Moreover, applying Proposition~\ref{prop:pvar_sum_x} 
  for the partition
  $\{a, t_{j-1}, t_j, b \}$ we have 
   \begin{eqnarray*}
    v_p(f, [a, b]) &=& v_p(f,[a, t_{j}]) 
      + v_p(f,[t_{j-1}, t_{j}]) + v_p(f,[t_{j}, b]) \\
    &=& v_p(f,[a, t_{j}]) + v_p(f,[t_{j-1}, x]) 
      + v_p(f,[x, t_{j}]) + v_p(f,[t_{j}, b])
  \end{eqnarray*}
  From the same proposition follows, that
  $\exists \kappa \in SP_p(f, [a, b]):x\in\kappa$,
  so, by definition, $x \in \overline{SP}_p(f,[a, b])$.  
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{lm:evenkappa}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM.
  If $K(f)$ is even, then
  \begin{equation}
    \exists x \in (a, b): x \in  \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b]). 
  \end{equation}       
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $f:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is PM.
  Lets take any $\{x_i\}_{i=0}^n \in X(f)$.
  If $n>1$, then without loss of generality
  we can assume that Proposition~\ref{prop:PM_form}(a) 
  holds. So, $f(x_0)>f(x_1)<f(x_2)>\dots$, i.e.
  $f(x_{2i-1})<(x_{2i})$, thus,
  if $n$ is even, then $f(x_{n-1})<(x_{n})$,
  therefore, point $x_{n}$ is not a global minimum.
  Since $f(x_0)>f(x_1)$, point $x_0$ is also
  not a global minimum. As a result,
  global minimum is in interval $(a, b)$,
  moreover, it is in $\overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])$ according to
  Lemma~\ref{prop:SplitMinMax}. 
\end{proof}


% Small increase
\begin{lemma}\label{lm:SI}
  Let $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be PM
  and $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^n \in PP[a, b]$.
  Suppose 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SI_1}
    \{t_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1} \in SP_p(f, [a, t_{n-1}]) 
  \end{equation} 
  and 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SI_2}
    \{t_i\}_{i=1}^{n} \in SP_p(f, [t_1, b]).
  \end{equation} 
  Then
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SI_3}
    \forall i \in \{1,\dots,n-1\}: t_i \in \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])
  \end{equation} 
  or
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SI_4}
    \forall i \in \{1,\dots,n-1\}: t_i \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])
  \end{equation}   
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let the assumptions of lemma be valid. 
  Firstly, suppose 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SI_p1}
    \exists j \in \{1,\dots,n-1\}: t_j \in \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b]).
  \end{equation}
  This means that 
  $\exists \kappa \in SP_p(f, [a, b]): t_j \in \kappa$.
  Then, by Proposition~\ref{prop:pvar_sum_x},
  \begin{equation}
    v_p(f, [a, b]) = v_p(f, [a, t_j]) + v_p(f, [t_j, b])
  \end{equation}
  
  Since (\ref{eq:SI_1}) and (\ref{eq:SI_2}) holds, 
  by Lemma~\ref{lm:spSubset} we get 
  \begin{eqnarray}
    v_p(f, [a, t_j]) = s_p(f, \{t_i\}_{i=0}^j), \\
    v_p(f, [t_j, b]) = s_p(f, \{t_i\}_{i=j}^n).
  \end{eqnarray}
  
  Therefore,
  \begin{equation}
    v_p(f, [a, b]) = s_p(f, \{t_i\}_{i=0}^j) +  s_p(f, \{t_i\}_{i=j}^n)
      = s_p(f, \{t_i\}_{i=0}^n).
  \end{equation}  
  
  So, $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^n \in SP_p(f, [a, b])$, 
  thus, statement (\ref{eq:SI_3}) holds.
  
  On the other hand, if (\ref{eq:SI_p1}) is not valid, 
  then statement (\ref{eq:SI_4}) holds.  
  
\end{proof}



\section{p-variation calculus}  
\label{sec:pvarcalc}  
  
In this chapter we will present the algorithm that calculates 
$p$-variation for the sample (see Def.~\ref{def:pvarseq}). 
Nonetheless, this algorithm could be used to calculate
the $p$-variation for arbitrary piecewise monotone function. 
This procedure will be called \emph{pvar}. 
It is already realised in the R (see~\cite{R}) package \emph{pvar} and
is publicly available on CRAN\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pvar/index.html
}

Firstly, we will give some introductory notes about the
procedure. Later on, the main schema of the
algorithm will be presented in the
Subsection~\ref{sub:MainFunction}. And finally, 
each step of the algorithm are disused in more details in 
Subsection~\ref{sec:DetailExplanation}.

\subsection{Introductory notes}


Suppose $X=\{X_{i}\}_{i=0}^{n}$ is any real-value sequence of numbers. 
We will call such sequence a \emph{sample}, 
whereas $n$ will be referred to as a \emph{sample size}
and refer as $|X|$.
The formal definition of $p$-variation 
of the sample is given in Definition~\ref{def:pvarseq}, 
which states that
\begin{equation}
  v_p(X) = v_p(G_X(t),[0,n]),
\end{equation}
where $G_X(t)$ is a sample function defined in  
Definition~\ref{def:Seq2Fun}.
On the other hand, 
$p$-variation of the sample could express as
\begin{equation}
  v_p(X) = \max\left\{ \sum_{i=1}^k |X_{j_i} - X_{j_{i-1}}|^p :
  0=j_0<\dots<j_k=n,\; k=1,\dots,n  \right\}.
\end{equation}
This expression could be verified from
Proposition~\ref{prop:sup_in_PM},
which states, that $p$-variation
is achieved in a subset of any partition $r \in X(f, [0,n])$.
So, we can construct $r$ from the subset $\{0, 1, \dots, n\}$. 
In this case, if $j \in \{0, 1, \dots, n\}$ then $G_X(j) = X_j$, thus,
$G_X(j)$ could be replaced with $X_j$. As a result,
we don't need to use $G_X(j)$ function, rather, 
the values of the sample $X_j$ could be used directly. 
This is the way algorithm works --
it actually operates the the values of the sample $X$,
not involving $G_X(t)$ function. Nonetheless,
then we will refer to properties of $p$-variation
we actually have in mind function $G_X(t)$, since all
the properties of $p$-variation are formulated for functions.

The members of the sample $X$ that are in supreme partition are
called \emph{supreme points}. All the members
that are not in supreme partition are refereed as
\emph{redundant} points -- 
those points could be removed from original sample without any effect to 
the value of $p$-variation.

The main idea of the algorithm is 
to identify redundant points in sample $X$ using known properties of
$p$-variation. As soon as point was identified being redundant, it could be 
doped out from further consideration. 
The set of points under the consideration 
will be denoted by (sub) sample $S$.
During the procedure this set is modified until it contains only the 
supreme points. 
The sample $S$ might be refer as a partition of $X$, 
since it indicates a subset of $X$.


In the initial stage we consider any point being a supreme point, 
so, in the very begging $S=X$. In further stages
some points might be doped from $S$.
For this purpose, 
the most important property that grounds
the algorithm is
stated in the Theorem~\ref{th:notinST}.
It allows to consider points in $S$ by analysing
not the whole sample, but much
smaller sub-samples. From the
Theorem~\ref{th:notinST} follows, that 
if a point was identify as redundant in any
small interval, then the point is redundant in
any larger interval as well. 
This property is used in several ways that will be revealed in 
further sections.


%Suppose we initialise $S \leftarrow X$ and we find out 
%that $j \notin SP_p(G_X, [0, n]),\;j \in \{0, 1, \dots, n\}$. 
%This means that
%$j$ is not in supreme partition. 
%Therefore, sample member $X_j$ is redundant 
%and should be excluded from further consideration.
%Removing $X_j$ means that we 
%updating sample $S$ by excluding $X_j$ element, namely, $S$ becomes 
%$$
%S \leftarrow \{X_0,\dots,X_{j-1},X_{j+1},\dots,X_n\}.
%$$


It is worth noting, 
that the procedure \emph{pvar} could be used to calculate
the $p$-variation of any piecewise monotone function.
Let assume $f$ is any piecewise monotone function.  
According to definition (see~\ref{def:PM}) 
there are points $a=x_1<\dots<x_n=b$ for some finite $n$ such 
that $f$ is monotone on each interval 
$[x_{j-1},x_j],\;j=1,2,\dots,n$.
We can calculate $p$-variation if we have the sample $X$, 
which contains the values of the function $f$ 
at the points $\{x_{i}\}_{i=0}^{n}$, namely,
$X=\{X_{i}\}_{i=0}^{n}:=\{f(x_{i})\}_{i=0}^{n}$.
It is straight forward to see that 
$f \stackrel{PM}{=} G_X$, 
therefore, if $p \geq 1$, then $v_p(X)=v_p(G_X)=v_p(f)$.


\subsection{Main function}
\label{sub:MainFunction}

The procedure \emph{pvar} that calculates
$p$-variation will be presented here. Firstly,
we will introduce the main schema, further, each step will
be discussed in more details. 
The main steps in \emph{pvar} procedure
goes as follows.


\paragraph{Procedure \emph{pvar}.}
Input: sample $X$, scalar $p$.

\begin{enumerate}
  
  \item \emph{Initialisation and checking}. We 
  consider any point being a supreme point,
  so, $S \leftarrow X$. 
  In normal case we proceed to next step, 
  but in special case there might
  be some exceptions. For example, 
  if $|X|=0$, then $X$ has only 1 point.
  In this case $p$-variation is equal to 0 by 
  Definition~\ref{def:pvar}, so, 
  further procedures are meaningless.
  Moreover, if $0 < p < 1$ then all the points must
  be included in supreme partitions.
  In further steps we will assume
  that $|X|>0$ and $p>1$.
  
  \item \emph{Removing monotonic points}. According to 
  Proposition~\ref{prop:sup_in_PM}
  all points that are not the end of 
  monotonic interval could be excluded 
  from further consideration. 
  
  \item \emph{Checking all small sub-samples}. 
  Every small sub-samples (with the predefined size) 
  are checked if it is possible to 
  identify redundant points. 
  This operation is based on 
  Theorem~\ref{th:notinST} which states that 
  if $x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [a', b'])$, then 
  $x \notin \overline{SP}_p(f, [a, b])$, where 
  $[a', b'] \subset [a,b]$.
  So, if $X_j$ appears to be redundant in
  any small sub-sample, then
  we do not need to consider possibility for
  $X_j$ to be in supreme sample any more. 
  More details are given in
  section~\ref{sec:CheckSubSamples}.  
 
  \item \emph{Merging small sub-samples}.  
  Let $\kappa_{a,c} \in SP_p(G_X, [a,c])$ and
  $\kappa_{c,b} \in SP_p(G_X, [c, b])$. 
  By using $\kappa_{a,c}$
  ans $\kappa_{c,b}$, we can effectively
  find $\kappa_{a,b} \in SP_p(G_X, [a, b])$, since
  $\kappa_{a,b} \subset \kappa_{a,c} \cup \kappa_{c,b}$. 
  Finding
  $\kappa_{a,b}$ from $\kappa_{a,c}$ and $\kappa_{c,b}$ 
  is called \emph{merging}.
  In this step we repeat merging of all
  small intervals until
  we get the finial supreme partition.
  The whole procedure is described in
  section~\ref{sec:meging}.  
  
  \item \emph{Calculating the value of $p$-variation}.  
  If the supreme partition is obtain, then
  the value of $p$-variaion is caluculated using 
  $p$-varion sum
  $$
  v_p = \sum_{i=1}^{|S|} |S_{i-1}-S_i |^p
  $$
  
  
\end{enumerate}



The corresponding pseudo-code of the main function goes as follows

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{The main function of \emph{pvar} procedure that calculates $p$-variation of the sample.}\label{alg:pvarmain}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Input sample $X$, scalar $p$.
\Require $p>0$.
\Output the value of $p$-variation of $X$
\Function{pvar}{$X$, $p$}
%\item[] \Comment{1. Initialization and checking}
\State $S \leftarrow X$ ; 
\If {$0<p \leq 1$} 
  \State value $\leftarrow \sum |S_{i-1}-S_i |^p $ ; 
  \State \textbf{return} value; 
\EndIf
\If {$|S|=0$}
  \State value $\leftarrow 0$;
  \State \textbf{return} value;
\EndIf

%\item[] \Comment{2. Removing monotonic points}
\State $S \leftarrow FindCorners(S)$;

%\item[] \Comment{3. Checking sub-samples. Check sub-intervals up to the size of $M$}
\State $M \leftarrow 3$ ;
\State $S \leftarrow CheckSubSamples (S, p, M)$;

%\item[] \Comment{4. Merging sub-samples starting form length $M+1$}
\State $S \leftarrow MergeAll (S,  p, M+1)$;

%\item[]\Comment{5. calculate the $p$-variation}
\State value $\leftarrow \sum |S_{i-1}-S_i |^p $ ; 

\State \textbf{return} value;
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


Function \emph{FindCorners} returns the
subset of $S$ that contains only the end of monotonic points (see Section~\ref{sec:RemoveMonotonicPoints}). 
Function \emph{CheckSubSamples} check all
sequential sub-samples with size up to $M$ and remove
all the points that appeared to be redundant (see Section~\ref{sec:CheckSubSamples}).
Function \emph{MergeAll} merges all small
sub-samples until the final supreme partitions is obtain (see Section~\ref{sec:meging}).

  
\subsection{Detail explanation}
\label{sec:DetailExplanation}

\subsubsection{Removing monotonic points}
\label{sec:RemoveMonotonicPoints}

According to Proposition~\ref{prop:sup_in_PM}
the $p$-variation is achieved 
on the partition of monotonic intervals.
Therefore the points that are not 
the end of monotonic interval are redundant 
and should be drop out.
The points that are the end of monotonic intervals
will be referred as \emph{corners}. 
In a single loop we can 
find all the corners by checking if the sequence
changed the direction form increasing to decreasing
(or vice versa). In addition, points $X[0]$ and $X[n]$
always included in the array of corners by definition.
The corresponding pseudo code looks as follows:


\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{The function \emph{FindCorners} that
returns the subset of $S$, which contains only the corners of $S$.}
\label{alg:FindCorners}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Input sample $S$
\Output sample $corners$ that is the subset of $S$, which contains only the corners
\Function{FindCorners}{$S$}


\State $corners \leftarrow S_0$;
\State $direction \leftarrow 0$;
\State $n \leftarrow |S|$;
\For{$i \leftarrow 1$ \textbf{ to } $n-1$}
  \If {$S_{i-1} < S_{i}$}
    \If {$direction < 0$}
      \State append $corners$ with element $S_{i-1}$;
    \EndIf
    \State $direction \leftarrow 1$ ;
  \EndIf
  \If {$S_{i-1} > S_{i}$}
    \If {$direction > 0$}
      \State append $corners$ with element $S_{i-1}$;
    \EndIf
    \State $direction \leftarrow -1$ ;
  \EndIf   
\EndFor
\State append $corners$ with element $S_{n}$; 
\State \textbf{return} corners;
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


This procedure is quite simple and
 can by performed very quickly, since it does not include
any cross checking and could be done in one loop.
In \emph{pvar} package all corners could be found with \emph{ChangePoints} function.



\subsubsection{Checking small sub-samples}
\label{sec:CheckSubSamples}

Proposition~\ref{prop:pvar_sum_x} and 
Lemmas~\ref{lm:SI} and~\ref{lm:evenkappa} gives an effective 
way to identify significant part of 
redundant points 
using quite simple operations. 
The pseudo code is given in the end the chapter and
now we will reveal the main principles.

Suppose $S$ is a sample without monotonic points. 
Let investigate a sub-sample of the size $m$ ($m=2,\dots,n-1$), 
namely, lets examine a sub-sample 
$\{S_{i}\}_{i=k}^{k+m}$
for any $k=0,...,n-m$.
According to Proposition~\ref{prop:pvar_sum_x},
If 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dropsamll1}
  \sum_{i=k+1}^{k+m} |S_{i}-S_{i-1}|^p < |S_j-S_{j+m}|^p,
\end{equation}
then,
partition $\{k,\dots,k+m\}$ 
can not be supreme partition in interval
$[k,k+m]$. 
Therefore, some of the points $\{S_{i}\}_{i=k+1}^{k+m-1}$
must be redundant.
Moreover, Lemmas~\ref{lm:SI} and~\ref{lm:evenkappa} 
gives opportunity easily identify 
redundant points. To do so, we must 
systemically investigate small sub-samples starting form
small $m$.

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Let $m=2$. Then $|\{S_{i}\}_{i=k}^{k+2}|=2$, 
thus according to
Lemma~\ref{lm:evenkappa}, the sub-sample
$\{S_{i}\}_{i=k}^{k+2}$ has at least one
inner supreme point. 
Since it has only one inner point (namely $S_{k+1}$), 
then this point must be a supreme point. 
So, if $m=2$, then  (\ref{eq:dropsamll1}) is always
invalid, therefore, we don't need to do any checking.

\item 
Let $m=3$. Firstly, we need to check if (\ref{eq:dropsamll1}) holds.
If so,
then at least one 
point must be redundant.
In addition, Lemma~\ref{lm:SI} ensures that 
both middle points $S_{k+1}$, $S_{k+2}$ 
are redundant, therefore, they both should be removed. 

We do this checking for  for all
$k=0,...,n-2$. In this way
we can identify quite an amount of redundant
points. Moreover, 
after removing them from the sample the 
sample changes, so we can repeat the same procedure
and find more redundant points. We do it until
no new redundant points are 
identified.

\item 
If $m=4$, then $|\{S_{i}\}_{i=k}^{k+4}|$ is even, 
thus, according to Lemma~\ref{lm:evenkappa}, 
the sub-sample
$\{S_{i}\}_{i=k}^{k+m}$ has at least one
inner supreme point. 
So, all inner points are supreme points, 
based on Lemma~\ref{lm:SI}, therefore, 
(\ref{eq:dropsamll1}) do not hold.
Lemma~\ref{lm:evenkappa} ensure
that this argument holds in all cases, then $m$ is even.
So, actually we need to investigate only the cases, then 
$m$ is odd. 

\item 
Let 
$m=5$ and all sub-samples
 $\{S_{i}\}_{i=k}^{k+3},\;k=0,...,n-3$ are already 
 checked.
If (\ref{eq:dropsamll1}) holds, then, based on
Lemma~\ref{lm:SI}, all middle points
$S_{k+1}$, $S_{k+2}$, $S_{k+3}$  and $S_{k+4}$ are  
identified as redundant and should be removed.
After removing points, the sample changes, thus,
if we want to apply this checking again,
then we should start checking from $m=3$ again, because
we must make sure that all sub-samples
$\{X_{i}\}_{i=k}^{k+3},\;j=0,...,n-3$ are already 
checked, because this is a requirement of the Lemma \ref{lm:SI}.

\item If we want to go further and check
sub-samples for $m=7,9,11\dots$, every time we have to
start from $m=3$ and increase $m$ by $2$ only then
(\ref{eq:dropsamll1}) is not valid for
all sub-samples.

\end{itemize}

We can continue this checking until $m$ 
reaches an arbitrary threshold $M$.
The  pseudo-code  of this procedure is given below

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Procedure \emph{CheckSubSamples}, which ensures 
that any sequential sub-sample of length $M$ is a supreme partition in corresponding interval.}
\label{alg:CheckSubSamples}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Input sample $S$, scalar $p$, scalar $M$
\Require $S$ must contain only the corners
\Output modified sample $S$ such that any sequential sub-sample of length $M$ is a supreme partition in corresponding interval

\Function{CheckSubSamples}{$S$, $p$, $M$}
\State $tempS \leftarrow NULL$ ;
\State $m \leftarrow 0$ ;
\While{$tempS \neq S$ {\bf and } $m < M$}
  \State $tempS \leftarrow S$ ;
  \State $m \leftarrow 3$ ;
  \State check all sub-samples of $S$ with length $m$ ;
  \State update $S$ by dropping all redundant points ;  
  \While{$tempS = S$ {\bf and } $m < M$}
    \State $m \leftarrow m + 2$ ;
    \State check all sub-samples of $S$ with length $m$ ;
    \State update $S$ by dropping all redundant points ; 
  \EndWhile
\EndWhile
\State \textbf{return} $S$;
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


With this procedure, we can actually find 
$p$-variation, setting $M$ to sufficiently large value.
But this way of finding $p$-variation is not effective, 
because in case of any modification of $S$ 
we should go back and start checking
from $m=3$.
So, it is reasonable to use this procedure
only for small $m$ and then go
to next step of $p$-variation calculus.
In \emph{pvar} package all corners could be found with \emph{CheckSmallIntervals} function.


\subsubsection{Merging supreme sub-samples}
\label{sec:meging}

Suppose it is already known that 
a sub-samples $\{S_{i}\}_{i=a}^{w}$  
and $\{S_{i}\}_{i=w}^{b}$
are a supreme partitions in intervals 
$[t_a,t_w]$ and $[t_w,t_b]$ correspondingly. 
The \emph{merge} operation of sub-samples 
$\{S_{i}\}_{i=a}^{w}$ and $\{S_{i}\}_{i=w}^{b}$
is an operation that finds supreme partition 
of the interval $[t_a,t_b]$ taking into account
that  $\{X_{i}\}_{i=a}^{w}$  and $\{X_{i}\}_{i=w}^{b}$
are a supreme partitions in corresponding intervals.

The final procedure in $p$-variation calculus will be
presented in this subsection. It is based on
merging operation. 
All the small sub-samples which were 
already checked in the 
previous procedure 
(see Section~\ref{sec:CheckSubSamples}) 
are merged pair by pair until  we end up having
the supreme partition.

This procedure has two stages that will be discussed separately.

\paragraph{Merge two supreme samples}

This paragraph will present how two supreme
sub-samples are merged .
Suppose $\{S_{i}\}_{i=a}^{w}$  and $\{S_{i}\}_{i=w}^{b}$
are a supreme partitions in corresponding intervals. 
According to Theorem~\ref{th:notinST},
the supreme partition in joined interval
must be a subset of 
$\{S_{i}\}_{i=a}^{b} = \{S_{i}\}_{i=a}^{w} \cup \{S_{i}\}_{i=w}^{b}$.
 
In order to find supreme partition in interval $[S_a,S_b]$
we need to investigate all possible
$f$-joints (Def.~\ref{def:fjoin}) between points $S_t, t\in \{a,\dots,w-1\}$ and
$S_r, r\in \{w,\dots,b\}$ and choose pair of points
$(t, r)$ which maximise $s_p$ function, namely  
\begin{eqnarray}
  (t, r) &:=& \argmax_{(i,j) \in [a, w-1] \times [w, b] } 
    \left\{ \sum_{k=a+1}^i |S_{k-1} + S_{k}|^p + |S_i-S_j|^p 
    + \sum_{k=j+1}^b |S_{k-1} + S_{k}|^p \right\}, \nonumber \\
  &=& \argmax_{(i,j) \in [a, w-1] \times [w, b] }  
    \left\{|S_i-S_j|^p +  \sum_{k=a+1}^b |S_{k-1} + S_{k}|^p  
    - \sum_{l=i+1}^j |S_{l-1} + S_{l}|^p  \right\}, \nonumber \\
   \label{eq:tr_argmax}  
   &=& \argmax_{(i,j) \in [a, w-1] \times [w, b] }  
    \left\{|S_i-S_j|^p - \sum_{l=i+1}^j |S_{l-1} + S_{l}|^p  \right\},   
\end{eqnarray}

In the special case then $t=w-1$ and $r=w$, the value 
of function in $\argmax$ is zero and the supreme
partition is $\{S_{i}\}_{i=a}^{b}$. 
So, in this case we do not 
need to do any modifications of the sample. 
This case is taken as baseline and we consider 
any modifications only then the value of function
in $\argmax$ is greater then zero.

In addition, the calculation of $(t, r)$ in (\ref{eq:tr_argmax})
could be optimised, since we actually do not need to check
all $(i,j) \in [a, v-1] \times [v+1, b]$. 
Based on Lemma~\ref{lm:fjoin},
points $X_t$ and $X_r$ could be $f$-joined only if 
\begin{equation}
  \forall i \in \{t,\dots,r\}: S_t \geq S_i \geq S_r \text{ or } 
  S_t \leq S_i \leq S_r.
\end{equation} 
   
And the last statement holds only if 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setT}
  S_t =  \min ( S_i : i \in \{t, \dots, w\}) 
    \text{ or } S_t =  \max ( S_i : i \in \{t, \dots, w\})
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setR}
  S_r =  \min ( S_i : i \in \{w, \dots, r\}) 
    \text{ or } S_r = \max ( S_i : i \in \{w, \dots, r\}).
\end{equation} 


Let $T$ denotes a set of $i \in \{a,\dots ,w-1\}$ which satisfy 
(\ref{eq:setT}) and $R$ denotes a set of 
$j \in \{w+1,\dots ,b\}$ which satisfy (\ref{eq:setR}).
Then (\ref{eq:tr_argmax}) 
could be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  (t, r) :=  
    \argmax_{(i,j) \in T \times R }  
    \left\{|S_i-S_j|^p - \sum_{l=i+1}^j |S_{l-1} + S_{l}|^p  \right\}.   
\end{equation} 

Since points $S_t$ and $S_r$ are $f$-joint, all the 
points in interval $t+1,\dots, r-1$ are redundant
and should be removed. And the remaining points are
the supreme partition.

\section{Conclusion}  
  
In this article we presented the algorithm
\emph{pvar} that calculates
$p$-variations of the sample. 
This algorithm is based on mathematical properties that 
were formulated and proved in the article.
The calculations of $p$-variation
is already available in R package \emph{pvar}.
The core of functions are written in C++,
therefore, algorithm is quite fast and it can calculate
$p$-variations for really large samples.
It is worth noting that $pvar$ procedure
could be used to analyse any 
piecewise monotone function, 
you just need to construct the proper sample.
